My course work at Reynolds included things like Statisitics, various Maths, Design and Art, Adobe PhotoShop and Flash, Java Programming, HTML / CSS, Web Design Capstone, mySQL, JavaScript, and more.

I embrace being a hipster and move to the west coast to see what the buzz is about. I take two 6 month on-site contracts through Aquent LLC. They had reached out to me from my blog I was running within my 'Dcoi Designs' company website. One contract I am working in a small eCommerce marketing dev shop. I'm doing things like building out adapative designs, working with optimizely, updating legacy web properties, optimizing websites for conversation as well as light Wordpress CMS and email stuff. Contract number two I am essentially building out a custom-responsive-interactive Wordpress CMS theme for internal Toyota employees to manage inventory and documents through a small Advertising Agency.

          I'm back in the Big snapple again working as a Front-End Web Developer for a small Ad Agency called 'Fly Communications, Inc', this time I'm living in Greenpoint Brooklyn. I'm doing things like websites, PSD > Code, Landing pages, working with SASS, JavaScript and different JS libraries, and emails. Toward the end of the year, a previous colleague from JUICE had just reached out to see if I was interested in an alluring contract offer at GSW Advertising that offered flex and remote working abilities.

          I return to my hometown area of Washington D.C. Metro. I quickly get a contract type offer as a Software Engineer for a small eLearning company creating Government Security Training Courses, with a big focus on 508 Accessibility. I also decide it's time to take the plunge and head back to School to obtain a relevant B.S. in the field, more so to validate my skills more then anything at this point, but also to have one and stay fresh. I begin a neat focused Cohort Major called 'Web Technologies'.
