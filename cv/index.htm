<button class="accordion">EXPERIENCE SUMMARY /</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>My background consists of about 6-7 years experience in Web; with primary duties of acting as a Front-End Web Developer, but also a Full-Stack Developer, Web Designer, and Entrepreneur. I created two freelance sole proprietors in the past, Dark Green LLC and â€˜Dcoi Designsâ€™ both with slightly different Web and Development niche services. I have also done a lot of contract work, varying 6 month to a year, and primarily on-site; I enjoyed this work setup as I got to see a variety of different types of projects and industry mediums. I've acted as a Dev in Marketing and Advertising environments, eLearning, Publishing, Pharma, and more. I'm full stack capable, but lean toward the front-end, passion wise.

  <p>Creative and curious Front-End Web Developer; with a passion for usability, ideas,  and clever progressive technology. I’m constantly learning, and improving. I will begin a M.I.S. program starting late fall of 2018 in ‘Information Systems Technology (Web Development)’  to push and solidify my skills and knowledge further. To stay up with trends I enjoy industry blogs and neat resources such as ‘FreeCodeCamp’. Outside of Software Development I hold additional interests in Business and Design. I look forward to working with a creative and open team on exciting and interesting interactive projects!</p>
